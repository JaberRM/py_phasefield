# Minimal Python Phase-Field Example 

This is a simple Allen-Cahn (non-conservative) and 
Cahn-Hiliard (conservative|) phase-field model.
The discretization is based on finite difference. 

The Gibbs energy in the Allen-Cahn model is temperature dependent. 

run with 

`` python main_ac.py``

or

``python main_ch.py``
